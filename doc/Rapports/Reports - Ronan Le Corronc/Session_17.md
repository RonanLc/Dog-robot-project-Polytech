# Week 12 - March 21, 2022 - 143h

During this session I focused on the laser cut parts. I modified the tibia by removing the 3D printed part at the strap. So we have only one piece in plexiglass which is much more resistant.

I was also able to help Maximilien to make the body of the robot, so we cut the many plexiglass plates. Printed the parts allowing the assembly. And made a first assembly of the body.
