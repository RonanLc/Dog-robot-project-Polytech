# Week 42 - October 18, 2022 - 17h

I focused this week on the robot leg. I looked at its design, its performance and how can I build something strong and light.

## **Leg schematic**

I realized that most of the existing robots were still designed in a similar way.

They all have a straight thigh and then a curved tibia so I decided to base the leg on that.

The thigh and the shin being generally of the same size, I decided to make the thigh and the shin of 15cm. This will allow us to make the robot go up to 30cm high in case we have to overcome big obstacles. This will also be more than enough to climb the steps.

## **Modeling of the leg**

As indicated in our report, I designed the thigh and the tibia so that they can be cut out of plexiglass. This will allow us to quickly change these parts if there is a problem because they are parts that will undergo strong constraints.

I then modeled the knee joint, then the hip joint. I decided to use mainly 3D printing to design the parts that hold the bearings.

The joints are almost finished. I have set up the materials of each part to have an idea of the weight of our future legs.

So now we have the look and design that our leg will have, this gives us an idea of the visual that our robot will have and also the weight and capabilities.

## **Next week**

The joints are now almost finished so I'm going to focus on modeling the transmissions and the motorization next week.

The next step will also be to design the shoulder which will contain the motors and the position sensors. Then to focus on the connection with the body. This will allow us to start the complete assembly of the robot and correct the different errors before starting the production.
