# Week 13 - March 28, 2023 - 148h

During this session I focused on the kinematic study of the robot. As explained in [Report No. 14](https://github.com/RonanLc/Snoopytech/blob/main/doc/Rapports/Reports%20-%20Ronan%20Le%20Corronc/Session_14.md) we have to find the mathematical formulas allowing to pass from an orthonormal reference X Y Z to the angles of the leg.

I decided to start over because my previous calculations were underdeveloped and wrong.
