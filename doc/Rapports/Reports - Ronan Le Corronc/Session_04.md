# Week 45 - November 15, 2022 - 26h

## Receiving and adding 3D parts

We have received some parts that we ordered. This will allow us to start the construction of the robot but first to finalize its 3D design.

We received the 30mm bearings, the belts, the pulleys of belts, a part of the ESC. So we have all these components:

*Green: components received / Blue: components waiting / Red: components without information*

So I was able to model some parts like the belt pulley.

## Shoulder modeling

I continued the modeling of the shoulder of the robot. I modeled the plexiglass plate that will hold the motors. It will slide between the upper and lower part of the shoulder.

So I could add the motors to the assembly and continue to model the shoulder shells to enclose them.

## Shoulder and leg assembly

With the motors added, I was able to continue modeling the shoulder and then assemble the leg to the rest of the assembly.

I added links to connect the angular displacement of the legs and the motors. But the reduction is still to be determined.

## Next week

I will focus on the attachment of the leg to the shoulder. The system must be reliable and strong. 

I will also add to the shoulder the mechanism with the potentiometers to measure the position of the legs.

Depending on the progress, we will be able to start building the robot at the end of the session.
