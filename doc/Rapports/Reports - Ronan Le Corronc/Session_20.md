## Construction of the robot support

In order to start our tests of the robot we had to hold it in the air. Thanks to that its legs don't touch the ground and we can make tests.

So I made a support to put it on.

I raised the robot of 40cm because at the maximum the legs are 30cm, that leaves us a margin not to touch the ground.

The robot rests on its plexiglass plate underneath. It rests on a wooden board that is the same size as its frame.

The whole support is made of wood. You can see it on the picture below

The prototype of the leg being now finished, I would dedicate myself to the production of the three other legs during the next sessions.
