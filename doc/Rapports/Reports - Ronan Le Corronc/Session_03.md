# Week 43 - October 28, 2022 - 22h

## Shoulder preliminary conception 

The leg was finish so I start working about the motor part and mostly **the shoulder part**. I made a lot of sketching because this part is the **most complex** of the leg build.

The shoulder must fit a lot of part in it :
- The 2 motors of the legs
- The belt of the hip speed reduction
- The 2 potentiometers to check the knee and hip position
- A cable connector to power all the leg part
- The pullet for the shoulder rotation

The difficulty here is to fit every thing in the shoulder. But the shoulder must be very **compact, light and also have a good design.**

## Shoulder modeling

I decided to made the shoulder in **2 part**, one for the top and one for the bottom. These parts will be made with a **3D printer**.

So I start to modeling the part to fix the shoulder on the frame. I decided to made an other tube, around the carbon fiber tube with 2 bearings.

After that I had to modeling someting to fix the 2 motors. I didn't want to fix the motors directly on 3D parts because it's not precise and solid enough.

So i decided to fix the motors on a **plexiglass piece**.

For that I modeled **a gutter** that can accommodate the plexiglass plate. So the 2 3D parts will close on the plexiglass piece.

The bottom part isn't finish yet but I start a assembly of the shoulder. I had the bottom and the top part, and the 2 bearing.

## Next week

During the next I'll continue the shoulder part.

Now I need to focus on the motors fixation and the transmission part. When the transmission will be done, I'll fix the shoulder to the rest of the leg.
