## Motor and support

Over this session, I focused of the implementation of the brushless motors we will be using (ACK-5312CP).
I began by modeling it from the dimensions found on the merchant's website.

My next aim was to find a solution allowing us to link the motors to the body.
I started by sketching on paper ideas around a support to maintain the motor at a vertical position. This fisrt set of support will be used for
the motors that lead the shoulder of the leg.

The first support holds the motor by its foot, while the other holds it by its axe.
I haven't figure out yet if the support that holds the motor by the foot will be 3D printed or not, the other possibility being that we could 
make it in steel. In the case we make it in steel, we might not need a support for the motor's axe. 
Thus, I only modeled the support for the motor's foot, since the modeling for the axe is similar.

## Assembly

Finally, I attached the head designed last week to the body to get a first preview of the assembly.
