# Worksession 16 - 13/03/2023

## Overview 

This session was mainly centered around the making and the building of the body.

## Building 

I rebuilt the body of the robot with the new versions of the pieces (described in the [Session 11]() and [Session 12]()).
I cut out the frames and planes parts in plexiglass. 
These pieces are :
 
    2 motor-axis-anchoring frames
    4 motor frames
    2 lining frames
    1 frame with holes for the camera mounts
    1 frame with holes for the Jetson Nano
    2 chassis plates

Furthermore, I launched 3D prints of the following pieces :

    4 ESC bed spacers 
    1 ESC bed 
    4 square maintening the frames together
    1 whole motor reducer
    1 entire shoulder

Once all the pieces were made, I proceded to the assembly of the body.

The result of the assembly is seen on the following picture :

## Review of the build

All the frames fit perfectly in their respective slots. 
The supports for the tube let the carbon tubes slide in without being loose. 
Screwing the frames and the squares onto the frames is time consuming but with the right tools can be done easily. 
The frame holding the motor is slightly loose and lets the motor move sideways. This could be corrected by increasing slightly the thickness of the frame.
The camera mount can be assembled with ease on the body.
The leg of the robot does not requiere any screwing to be mounted. The carbon fiber tubes simply need to be inserted in the leg's bearing. 
The holes of the frame holding the axis of the motor are too wide, resulting in the bearings sliding out of them. 


## Next week's objective 

For next week's session, I will attend to hook up the third motor onto the leg. This underlines that I will need to find a (temporarely) solution for the potentiometer.
