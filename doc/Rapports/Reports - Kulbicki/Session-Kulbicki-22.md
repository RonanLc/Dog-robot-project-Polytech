# Worksession 22 - 02/05/2023

## Overview 

During this session, my work was focused on the building of the legs of the robot. 

## Manufacturing 

Having all the necessary elements to assemble the four legs, I proceded to do so.

The motor-reducers of each leg needed to be grease in order to obtain silent motors.
I also shared the soldering of the mouthpiece of the motors and ESCs with Ronan. 

Furthermore, I have decided to cut the ESC beds in plexiglass in reason of the higher speed of production compared to 3D printing. 
The result is solid and easily supports an ESC.

## Remaining tasks

The connexion of all the ESC to the power supply still remains undone and the legs haven't been mounted to the body yet. 
The code implementing the math hasn't been written yet.
