## Camera and ultrasound sensor

During this session, my work was focused on the recherch and the conception/design of a piece allowing our camera and ultrasound sensor to rotate at an angle of 180Â°. 
Each sensor will have its own support, which will use a servo motor SG-90 to rotate. 
Thus, I needed to design a support for the servo that makes its rotation axis the same as the support's swivel axis.
This allows to reduce the amount of transmissions between the motor and the swivel axis.

All the designed parts will surely be 3D printed. 

## Force study

Furthermore, I got interested in the sturdiness and strength of the body of the robot.
So, I conducted a force study on the body thanks to Fusion360.
When applying a force described by a norm of 20N (the equivalent of a 2kg weight), vertical and directed towards the ground, on the frame of the body at the extremities of the tubes, no distorsions are to be seen.

On the picture above, the colours close to blue reprensent an absence of distorions of the piece when put under stress. On the other side, the lighter colours represent a strong distorsion when the body undergoes stress.
Thereby, the body seems capable of withstanding the totale weight that it will be exposed to.
