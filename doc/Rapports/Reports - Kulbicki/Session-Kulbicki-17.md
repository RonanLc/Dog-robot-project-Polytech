# Worksession 17 - 21/03/2023

## Overview 

During this short session I worked on the body of the robot.

# Machining 

I began this session by dismantling the body of the robot to change the old shoulder with the new version.
This version includes supports for the new potentiometers we received.

Unfortunately, while taking the shoudler apart, I broke two of the vertical frames holding the carbon tubes.
These frames broke for a quaint reason being that I cut them in a plexiglass sheet that had already been used and was partially cut.
This means that integrity of the frames was compromised.

I proceded to cut new frames in brand new plexiglass, preventing the same mistake from happening.

New metal rodes also needed to be cut and shaped for the potentiometer's mouthpiece.

I now have all the necessary pieces to assemble an entire leg on the body, I might just need to drill a few holes in the carbon tubes to screw the potentiometer's housing.

## Next week's objective

Once the whole leg with the three potentiometers are mounted, I will code a simple program to test the mobility of each joint.
