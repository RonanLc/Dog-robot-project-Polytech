# Notice

This section contains all the requiered elements for the building of the robot. 

You will find all the files under two extensions :

1. the ```.3mf``` extension for the 3D printed piece
2. the ```.dxf``` for the laser cut elements

The 3D printed piece can all be done using the same hard filament (PLA/ABS/PETG/...).

The laser cut elements must be cut in 3mm thick plexiglass (or wood). 

# Preview
