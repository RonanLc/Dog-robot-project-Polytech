# Notice 

This section covers the frame of the robot, the vessel for all the components. 

Most of the parts are cut in plexiglass (or wood) for a faster building time.

The other [bits](https://github.com/RonanLc/Snoopytech/tree/main/building/frame/bits) are used to maintain the frames together or for an external use. 

# Preview
